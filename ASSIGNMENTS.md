ASSIGNMENTS
======

Assignment 1:
------
Write a CUDA program to calculate the element-wise sum of two large (32M elements or greater) arrays. The arrays contain single precision floating point numbers. Generate your input arrays. Check the correctness of your results.

<b>Deadline:</b> 22nd April 2020

Assignment 2:
------
Write a CUDA program to calculate the addition of 2 large matrices. The matrices contain single precision floating point numbers. Generate your input matrices. Check the correctness of your results.

<b>Deadline:</b> 26th April 2020

Assignment 3:
------
Write a CUDA program to implement in-place matrix transpose. Your GPU kernel should take in only one matrix of integers as parameter, and by the end of the kernel, the same matrix should be storing the transpose of the original one.
(Make sure to take care of the synchronization of read and write operations on the matrix).

<b>Deadline:</b> 2nd May 2020
